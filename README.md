# mc-XY-model
Monte-Carlo simulation of the 2D XY model. This document includes multiple MC algorithms. It has 

(v1) - Local Metropolis algorithm
(v2) - Wolff cluster update
(v3) - Wolff + Parallel Tempering update
(v4) - Wolff + Self-Adaptative Parallel Tempering update (work in progress)

All simulations run using run.py, and all use the file all_data_process.py to compute error bars on the MC observables using the Jackknife method.
